  - Always handle errors. Do not ignore them.
  - Return errors with context when necessary.

### 3.2 **Code Formatting**
- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
- **Line Length**: Limit all lines to a maximum of 80 characters.
- **Spacing**:
  - Use a single space after commas, colons, and semicolons.
  - Use a single space around operators (assignment, comparison, arithmetic).
- **Braces**: 
  - Place opening braces on the same line as the statement.
  - Place closing braces on a new line, aligned with the opening statement.

### 3.3 **Documentation**
- **Docstrings (Python)**: 
  - Use triple double quotes for docstrings.
  - Include a brief description, parameters, return values, and exceptions raised.
```python
def example_function(param1, param2):
    """
    Brief description of the function.

    Args:
        param1 (type): Description of param1.
        param2 (type): Description of param2.

```javascript
/**
 * Brief description of the function.
 * 
 * @param {type} param1 - Description of param1.
 * @param {type} param2 - Description of param2.
 * @returns {type} Description of the return value.
 */
function exampleFunction(param1, param2) {
    // function body
}
```
- **GoDoc (Golang)**: 
  - Use comments directly above the declarations.
  - Start comments with the name of the function or type being described.
```go
// ExampleFunction does something with param1 and param2.
func ExampleFunction(param1 int, param2 string) error {
    // function body
    return nil
}
```

### 3.4 **Naming Conventions**

### 3.5 **Error Handling**
- **Exceptions (Python)**: 
  - Use specific exception types.
  - Provide clear error messages.
  - Log exceptions where appropriate.
```python
try:
    # code that may raise an exception
except ValueError as e:
    logger.error(f"ValueError: {e}")
```
- **Errors (JavaScript)**: 
  - Use `try...catch` for error handling.
  - Provide clear error messages.
  - Log errors where appropriate.
```javascript
try {
    // code that may throw an error
} catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
}
```
- **Errors (Golang)**: 
  - Check and handle errors after calling functions.
  - Provide context to errors when necessary.
  - Use `errors.New` or `fmt.Errorf` to create new errors.
```go
if err := someFunction(); err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("someFunction failed: %v", err)
}
```

### 3.6 **Code Reviews**
- **Purpose**: Ensure code quality, consistency, and knowledge sharing.
- **Process**:
  - Review code for adherence to coding standards.
  - Check for potential bugs and logical errors.

- **Readability**: Write clear, understandable code. Optimize for readability over cleverness.
- **Performance**: Consider the performance impact of your code. Profile and optimize critical sections.



## 4. **Version Control**

### 4.1 **Branching Strategy**
- **Main Branch**: The `main` (or `master`) branch should always be in a deployable state.
- **Feature Branches**: 
  - Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.
  - Use descriptive names for feature branches (e.g., `feature/add-user-authentication`, `bugfix/fix-login-error`).
- **Release Branches**: 
  - Create a release branch when preparing for a new release (e.g., `release/v1.0`).
  - Only critical bug fixes and release-specific changes should be made on release branches.
- **Hotfix Branches**: 
  - Use hotfix branches for urgent fixes to production (e.g., `hotfix/fix-critical-bug`).
  - Merge hotfix branches back into `main` and `develop` branches after the fix is applied.

### 4.2 **Commit Messages**
- **Structure**: Follow a consistent format for commit messages.
  - **Header**: A short summary of the change (50 characters or less).
  - **Body**: A detailed explanation of the change, including the rationale and any relevant context (wrap at 72 characters).
  - **Footer**: Any references to issues or breaking changes.
- **Example**:
  ```
  Short summary of the change

  Detailed explanation of the change. Include the rationale and any
  relevant context. Use bullet points if necessary.

  Fixes #123
  ```

### 4.3 **Pull Requests**
- **Description**: Provide a clear and concise description of the changes in the pull request.
- **Reviewers**: Assign appropriate reviewers based on the code changes.
- **Checklists**: Include checklists for:
  - Code functionality
  - Code style adherence
  - Tests written and passing
  - Documentation updated (if necessary)
- **Review Process**: 
  - Reviewers should provide constructive feedback.
  - Ensure that all comments are addressed before merging.
  - Use "Approve" or "Request Changes" to indicate the review outcome.

### 4.4 **Merging**
- **Rebase and Merge**: Use rebase to keep a linear history and merge the feature branch into `main`.
- **Squash and Merge**: Combine multiple commits into a single commit for a cleaner history, especially for minor changes or bug fixes.
- **Merge Conflicts**: Resolve conflicts locally before merging.
- **Pre-Merge Checks**: Ensure that:
  - All tests pass.
  - The code is reviewed and approved.
  - There are no conflicts with the `main` branch.

### 4.5 **Tagging and Releases**
- **Tagging**: 
  - Use tags for marking release points (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
  - Follow Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for tags.
- **Release Notes**: 
  - Document the changes included in each release.
  - Highlight any breaking changes, new features, and bug fixes.

### 4.6 **Best Practices**
- **Commit Often**: Make small, incremental commits to make it easier to track changes and roll back if needed.
- **Meaningful Commits**: Each commit should represent a meaningful change or logical unit of work.
- **Review and Refactor**: Regularly review and refactor code to improve quality and maintainability.
- **Branch Protection**: Enable branch protection rules to prevent direct pushes to `main` and enforce review policies.



## 5. **API Design**

### 5.1 **RESTful Principles**
- **Resource-Based**: Design APIs around resources (e.g., users, orders) rather than actions.
- **HTTP Methods**:
  - **GET**: Retrieve resources.
  - **POST**: Create new resources.
  - **PUT**: Update existing resources.
  - **DELETE**: Remove resources.
  - **PATCH**: Partially update resources.
- **URI Structure**: Use clear and consistent URIs.
  - Example: `/api/v1/users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}`
- **Statelessness**: Each request should contain all the information needed to process it.
- **HATEOAS**: Implement Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State to provide clients with navigable links to related resources.

### 5.2 **Versioning**
- **URI Versioning**: Include the version number in the URI.
  - Example: `/api/v1/resource`
- **Header Versioning**: Use custom headers to specify the API version.
  - Example: `Accept: application/vnd.yourapi.v1+json`
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure that new versions do not break existing clients.
- **Deprecation Strategy**: Clearly document and communicate deprecation schedules.

### 5.3 **Error Handling**
- **Standard HTTP Status Codes**:
  - **200 OK**: Successful GET request.
  - **201 Created**: Successful POST request resulting in a new resource.
  - **204 No Content**: Successful request with no body content.
  - **400 Bad Request**: Client-side input validation error.
  - **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication failure.
  - **403 Forbidden**: Authorization failure.
  - **404 Not Found**: Resource not found.
  - **500 Internal Server Error**: Server-side error.
- **Error Response Format**: Provide a consistent error response format.
  ```json
  {
      "error": {
          "code": "400",
          "message": "Invalid request",
          "details": [
              {
                  "field": "username",
                  "message": "Username is required"
              }
          ]
      }
  }
  ```
- **Validation Errors**: Return detailed validation error messages to help clients correct their requests.

### 5.4 **Authentication and Authorization**
- **Authentication**: Use industry-standard methods (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT) for authenticating users.
- **Authorization**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC).
- **API Keys**: For services that do not require user authentication, use API keys for authentication.
- **Secure Endpoints**: Ensure that sensitive endpoints are protected and require authentication.

### 5.5 **Rate Limiting and Throttling**
- **Rate Limits**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
  - Example: Limit requests to 1000 per hour per user.
- **Throttling**: Throttle excessive requests to maintain service availability.
- **Headers**: Provide rate limit information in response headers.
  - Example: `X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining: 750`, `X-RateLimit-Reset: 3600`

### 5.6 **Pagination**
- **Limit and Offset**: Use query parameters to paginate results.
  - Example: `/api/v1/resources?limit=10&offset=20`
- **Page and Size**: Another approach using page number and size.
  - Example: `/api/v1/resources?page=2&size=10`
- **Metadata**: Include pagination metadata in responses.
  ```json
  {
      "data": [/* resources */],
      "meta": {
          "total": 100,
          "limit": 10,
          "offset": 20
      }
  }
  ```

### 5.7 **Filtering and Sorting**
- **Filtering**: Allow clients to filter results using query parameters.
  - Example: `/api/v1/resources?status=active&category=books`
- **Sorting**: Allow clients to sort results using query parameters.
  - Example: `/api/v1/resources?sort=createdAt,desc`
- **Complex Queries**: Support complex query parameters for advanced filtering.
  - Example: `/api/v1/resources?filter[status]=active&filter[price][gt]=10`

### 5.8 **Documentation**
- **OpenAPI/Swagger**: Use OpenAPI Specification (formerly Swagger) for API documentation.
- **Interactive Docs**: Provide interactive API documentation (e.g., Swagger UI, Redoc) for developers to test endpoints.
- **Examples**: Include request and response examples in the documentation.
- **Consistency**: Ensure that the documentation is consistent with the actual implementation and kept up-to-date.

### 5.9 **Best Practices**
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistency in naming conventions, response formats, and error handling across the API.
- **Scalability**: Design APIs with scalability in mind, considering caching, load balancing, and horizontal scaling.
- **Security**: Regularly review and update security practices to protect against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF).
- **Performance**: Optimize endpoints for performance, considering response times and payload sizes.
- **Deprecation Policy**: Clearly communicate any deprecations and provide a transition period for clients to adapt.



## 6. **Database Management**

### 6.1 **PostgreSQL**
#### 6.1.1 Schema Design
- **Normalization**: Normalize tables to reduce redundancy and ensure data integrity.
- **Indexes**: Use indexes to improve query performance. Avoid over-indexing as it can slow down write operations.
- **Constraints**: Use constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints) to enforce data integrity.
- **Data Types**: Use appropriate data types for each column (e.g., `UUID` for unique identifiers, `JSONB` for storing JSON data).

#### 6.1.2 Migrations
- **Tools**: Use migration tools like Flyway or Alembic for managing database migrations.
- **Version Control**: Version control migration scripts alongside application code.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure that migrations are backward compatible to allow for smooth rollbacks.

#### 6.1.3 Query Optimization
- **EXPLAIN**: Use the `EXPLAIN` command to analyze and optimize queries.
- **Joins**: Optimize joins by indexing the joined columns.
- **Subqueries**: Avoid subqueries in favor of joins where possible.
- **Caching**: Use caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data.

#### 6.1.4 Triggers
- **Definition**: Use triggers to automatically execute a specified function in response to certain events on a table or view.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Keep trigger logic simple to avoid performance issues.
  - Document the purpose and logic of triggers.
  - Use triggers for tasks like auditing, enforcing business rules, and maintaining derived columns.
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER update_timestamp
BEFORE UPDATE ON my_table
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION update_timestamp();
```

#### 6.1.5 Stored Procedures
- **Definition**: Use stored procedures to encapsulate logic that is executed on the database server.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use stored procedures for complex operations that require multiple SQL statements.
  - Ensure stored procedures are well-documented.
  - Test stored procedures thoroughly before deploying to production.
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE increment_salary(emp_id INT, increment NUMERIC)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    UPDATE employees
    SET salary = salary + increment
    WHERE id = emp_id;
END;
$$;
```

#### 6.1.6 Views
- **Definition**: Use views to create virtual tables that provide a specific representation of the data.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use views to simplify complex queries and provide a layer of abstraction.
  - Document views to explain their purpose and logic.
  - Use materialized views for performance optimization if the view is complex and queried frequently.
```sql
CREATE VIEW active_users AS
SELECT id, username, email
FROM users
WHERE status = 'active';
```

### 6.2 **MongoDB**
#### 6.2.1 Schema Design
- **Document Structure**: Design documents to match the application’s data access patterns.
- **Embedding vs. Referencing**: Embed data for one-to-few relationships and reference for one-to-many relationships.
- **Indexes**: Create indexes on frequently queried fields to improve read performance.

#### 6.2.2 Migrations
- **Tools**: Use migration tools like MongoDB’s `mongomigrate` or custom scripts.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure that migrations do not break existing data or queries.

#### 6.2.3 Query Optimization
- **Indexes**: Regularly analyze and optimize indexes using `explain()` method.
- **Aggregation Framework**: Use MongoDB’s aggregation framework for complex queries.
- **Sharding**: Implement sharding for horizontal scaling in large datasets.

#### 6.2.4 Aggregation Framework
- **Aggregation Pipelines**: Use pipelines to process data in stages.
  - **Stages**: Common stages include `$match`, `$group`, `$project`, `$sort`, `$limit`, and `$lookup`.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Grouping and Summarizing**:
      ```json
      db.orders.aggregate([
        { $match: { status: "active" } },
        { $group: { _id: "$customerId", totalAmount: { $sum: "$amount" } } },
        { $sort: { totalAmount: -1 } }
      ]);
      ```
    - **Joining Collections**:
      ```json
      db.orders.aggregate([
        { $lookup: {
          from: "customers",
          localField: "customerId",
          foreignField: "_id",
          as: "customerDetails"
        }},
        { $unwind: "$customerDetails" },
        { $project: { _id: 0, customerId: 1, "customerDetails.name": 1, amount: 1 } }
      ]);
      ```
- **Performance**: Optimize aggregation pipelines by placing `$match` and `$sort` stages early in the pipeline and by creating indexes on the fields used in these stages.

### 6.3 **Redis for Caching**
#### 6.3.1 Data Caching
- **Keys and Values**: Use descriptive keys and appropriate data structures (e.g., strings, hashes, lists).
- **Expiration**: Set expiration times (`TTL`) for cache entries to manage memory usage.
- **Patterns**: Use common caching patterns like Cache-Aside, Write-Through, and Write-Behind.

#### 6.3.2 Performance
- **Persistence**: Configure Redis persistence (RDB, AOF) based on data durability requirements.
- **Cluster Mode**: Use Redis Cluster for high availability and partitioning.
- **Monitoring**: Monitor Redis performance metrics and set alerts for key performance indicators.

### 6.4 **General SQL Guidelines**
- **Schema Design**: Normalize data but also consider denormalization for read-heavy workloads.
- **Indexes**: Use indexes wisely to speed up queries but avoid excessive indexing.
- **Transactions**: Use transactions to ensure data integrity in multi-step operations.
- **Stored Procedures**: Use stored procedures and functions for encapsulating complex logic.
- **Views**: Use views to simplify complex queries and abstract data layers.
